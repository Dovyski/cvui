# Installation

cvui is a header-only lib, so there is no real need to install it. All you have to do is place the `cvui.h` (or `cvui.py`) file along with the rest of your source code and compile/run your project.

Check the [usage page]({{ site.url }}/usage) to learn how to use cvui.

## Note to Python users

The Python version of cvui, i.e. `cvui.py`, can be conveniently installed using `pip`:

```
pip install cvui
```
