/**
 Start a new row.
 
 One of the most annoying tasks when building UI is to calculate 
 where each component should be placed on the screen. cvui has
 a set of methods that abstract the process of positioning
 components, so you don't have to think about assigning a
 X and Y coordinate. Instead you just add components and cvui
 will place them as you go.

 You use `beginRow()` to start a group of elements. After `beginRow()`
 has been called, all subsequent component calls don't have to specify
 the frame where the component should be rendered nor its position.
 The position of the component will be automatically calculated by cvui
 based on the components within the group. All components are placed
 side by side, from left to right.

 E.g.

 ```
 beginRow(frame, x, y, width, height);
  text("test");
  button("btn");
 endRow();
 ```

 Rows and columns can be nested, so you can create columns/rows within
 columns/rows as much as you want. It's important to notice that any
 component within `beginRow()` and `endRow()` *do not* specify the position
 where the component is rendered, which is also true for `beginRow()`.
 As a consequence, **be sure you are calling `beginRow(width, height)`
 when the call is nested instead of `beginRow(x, y, width, height)`**,
 otherwise cvui will throw an error.

 E.g.

 ```
 beginRow(frame, x, y, width, height);
  text("test");       
  button("btn"); 

  beginColumn();      // no frame nor x,y parameters here!
   text("column1");
   text("column2");
  endColumn();
 endRow();
 ```

 Don't forget to call `endRow()` to finish the row, otherwise cvui will throw an error.

 \param theWhere the image/frame where the components within this block should be rendered.
 \param theX position X where the row should be placed.
 \param theY position Y where the row should be placed.
 \param theWidth width of the row. If a negative value is specified, the width of the row will be automatically calculated based on the content of the block.
 \param theHeight height of the row. If a negative value is specified, the height of the row will be automatically calculated based on the content of the block.
 \param thePadding space, in pixels, among the components of the block.

 You use `beginColumn()` to start a group of elements. After `beginColumn()`
 has been called, all subsequent component calls don't have to specify
 the frame where the component should be rendered nor its position.
 The position of the component will be automatically calculated by cvui

 below each other, from the top of the screen towards the bottom.

 E.g.

 ```
